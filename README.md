### 2G Network Data

The goal of this project is to anonymously gather data on how much either A5/1 or A5/3 algorithms are still in use in 2G networks.
For the data collection process and RTL-SDR (or any SDR) is used as it is the most plug-and-play option.
The heavy lifting is done by the gr-gsm software suite, especially grgsm_livemon / grgsm_livemon_headless.
